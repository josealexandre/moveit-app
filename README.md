This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app developed for study purposes.

It uses the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to make you move and rest your body after each work interval.

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
